                    <h3>Our Founder</h3>
                    <p>Lee Byung-chul Founder of Samsung Group was born in Uriyeong, Gyeongsangnam-do,
                        and Korean Empire on 12th February, 1910.
                        He got college education at Waseda University located in Tokyo.
                        But He left his education due to the death of his father.
                        After his fatherâ€™s death the property and money which he got as the heir of the family,
                        he used those resources to open up a rice mill. He opened that rice mill in his native town named Gyeongnam.
                        His business of rice mill was not successful so he changed the nature of his business.
                        he opened a new business in Daegu on 1st March,1938.
                        That business was a trucking company which was involved in providing transporting services. 
                        He named that company as Samsung Trading Co. That company was just a sample of the bigger Samsung Group Company present today.</p>

                    <h3>Meet Our Chariman</h3>
                    <p>Lee joined the Samsung Group in 1968 and took over the chairmanship on December 1,
                        1987, just two weeks after the death of his father, Lee Byung-chul, who founded
                        Samsung. In the early 1990s, believing that Samsung Group was overly focused
                        on producing massive quantities of low-quality goods and that it was not prepared
                        to compete in quality, Lee famously said in 1993 "Change everything except your wife
                        and kids" and true to his word attempted to reform the profoundly Korean 
                        culture that had pervaded Samsung until this point. Foreign employees were brought
                        in and local employees were shipped out as Lee tried to foster a more international
                        attitude to doing business.Under Lee's guidance, the company has been transformed from a
                        Korean budget name into a major international force and arguably the most prominent
                        Asian brand worldwide.</p>
